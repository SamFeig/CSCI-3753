The results of this data show that the resolver threads have a greater impact on the runtime of the program than the requester threads. This comes from the fact that the majority of the computational time comes from the 'dnslookup' function call which gets multithreaded using the resolvers. This results in the largest speed increase with many resolver threads to one requester thread per input file. This same trend can be seen in the 'performance.png' graph file generated by the 'performance.py' file. This shows that across all requester thread numbers 1-10, at 1 resolver thread, runtime is slow. This is because the bottleneck is with the single resolver thread instead of with the increasing number of requester threads but when the resolver tyhread number is increased, the program speeds up at all requester thread numbers.
